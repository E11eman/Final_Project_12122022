//I wasn't able to complete everything with this assignment but I learned a lot after getting stuck on issues for hours/even days.I enjoyed working on this and hope it shows that I took something away from the class this semester. Problem solving was a skill I had to use a lot for this project, and even though all the problems weren't fixed in the designated time to turn this in, it is a skill I will take with me and improve upon as I go further in my computer science carreer.

//I was surprised how much I had to step back and look at the code differently. Because I would work on the cart for hours and get nowhere but then looked at it more simlistically and saw I was overcomplicating it.

//All in all, this was another enjoyable Semester. Thanks for being a great Instructor, and Happy Holidays! :)
